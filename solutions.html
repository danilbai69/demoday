    <h1>What are some solutions to global warming?</h1>
    <h2>Although it will be difficult to revert the effects of global warming, there are ways we can limit it.</h2>
    <ul>
         <li>Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions</li>
        <p>By shifting gears to electric vehicles, limiting energy usage, and utilizing renewable energy can help reduce greenhouse gases.</p>
        <li>Protecting land and agriculture</li>
        <p>By planting trees and banning deforestation, we can absorb more air from the atmosphere. We can promote healthy agriculture habits for farmers and protect ecosystems.</p>
        <li>Even changing our everyday behavior can benefit the cause.</li>
        <p>We must make sure we ride our bicycles more often, turn the lights off when we aren't in the room, and recycling materials all contribute to fighting global warming.</p>
    </ul>
